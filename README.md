# 311-Issues
Issue tracking for the 311 public release
<br/>
## How to Use this Github
This Github is for the 311 team and in-person support members to communicate questions and issues when we go live with Salesforce.
<br/>
### Types of Issues
#### Business Process Issues
Something isn't working the way it should with the process or flow of the service request type.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
* SLA is off
* Activities don't reflect what staff actually do
* Missing questions or unnecessary questions
* Incorrect or missing outcomes
* User can't see queues or service requests
<br/>Submit an issue and label it with business process label. We'll have to verify with supervisors and the internal 311 team before making changes.
<br/>
#### Enhancement
<br/>Something that might seem like a business process issue might turn out to be an enhancement. Enhancements are suggestions for improvements or changes. <br/>
#### Technical Issues or Bugs
<br/>The system itself is glitchy and isn't working as expected.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
* A service request is going to the wrong queue
* Location isn't working
* Service Request is submitting without all required fields filled out
* Details aren't showing up on the detail page
* User can't update case
* User can't complete an activity
<br/>
Check user permissions and then submit a github issue. Their permissions might be limiting their ability to complete an action. If their permissions are fine, submit an issue. Our core team will look at the issue and determine next steps. <br/>
#### Questions
<br/>If you need more information about a specific process or run into something you don't have an answer to, you can submit an issue with the question label for the 311 team. For questions that are more urgent or need a fast response, label the issue with help needed.
